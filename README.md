# Earthquakes-Last-7-Days

# Overview
Created a leaflet map using leaflet and fetched data from USGS GeoJSON's live feed (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). 

# About
The map plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake 
in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. The map includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked and the legend shows what the different colors represent, by magnitude.
